Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
It helps us understand how changes in the predictors influence the outcome, enabling predictions and insights into data patterns.

Types of Regression

Simple Regression: Models the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable.

Multiple Regression: Extends simple regression to include multiple independent variables.

Polynomial Regression: Fits a non-linear relationship by using polynomial terms of the independent variables.

Feature Selection Methods:
Effective feature selection techniques are crucial for improving model performance and interpretability.
Common methods include:

Forward Selection: Starts with no predictors and adds them one by one based on statistical significance.
Backward Elimination: Begins with all predictors and removes the least significant ones iteratively.
